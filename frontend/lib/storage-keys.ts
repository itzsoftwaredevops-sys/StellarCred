/**
 * Central enumeration of all StellarCred localStorage keys.
 * 
 * Every feature that persists state should be listed here so that:
 * 1. The data wipe flow (#558) can remove everything without orphaning keys
 * 2. New storage features are caught at review time
 * 3. Cross-tab sync and migration logic can discover all keys in one place
 * 
 * Rules:
 * - Add new storage keys here when adding features that persist to localStorage
 * - Update the JSDoc when keys are deprecated or change semantics
 * - Never remove an entry — mark it deprecated instead, so old data can still be cleaned
